EXERCISE II - Part 1 - Question 3:
N in question 2a is prime whereas N in question 2b is not. This means the linear
equation in ZN has no solution for question 2b, as computing the mod inverse -
required in the calculation - has no solution if two values are not relatively
prime; N in this case is not prime at all.

EXERCISE II - Part 2 - Question 3:
Once key exchange has completed, a secure channel for further communication can
be created by each participant storing this session key, and requiring it as
an additional input on further messages; thereby ensuring that they have not
been intercepted and in fact exchanging messages with an attacker.

EXERCISE II - Part 2 - Question 4a:
Eve can intercept Alice's public value, then sending her own public value to
Bob. When Bob responds, Eve then also intercepts this and sends her own response
back to Alice. Alice and Eve therefore agree on a shared key, as do Eve and Bob
agree on another shared key; this allows Eve to intercept, decrypt and
potentially modify communications between Alice and Bob, without either knowing
of Eve's presence.
